We can confirm that the container we're connected to in namespaces of the host by using ps aux.
To escape the Docker, we can use the following exploit:
nsenter --target 1 --mount sh which does the following:
1. --target 1 switch with the value of "1" to execute our shell command that we later provide to execute in the namespace of the special system process ID, to get ultimate root.
2. Specifying --mount this where we provide the mount namespace of the process that we are targeting.
"If no file is specified, enter the mount namespace of the target process".
As we are targeting the "/sbin/init" process #1 (although it's actually a symbolic link to "lib/systemd/systemd" for backwards-compatibility), we are using the namespace and permissions of the systemd daemon for our new process (the shell)

Here's where our process that will be executed into this privileged namespace: sh or a shell. This will execute in the same namespace (and therefore privileges of) the kernel.
