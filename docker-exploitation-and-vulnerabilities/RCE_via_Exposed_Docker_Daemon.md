Sometimes docker can be set up to be used remotely, this way when enumerating a target with nmap we might find docker running on a target.
Check if we can interact with the Docker Daemon. If it works we get a result looking like this.
curl http://TARGET-IP:PORT/version:

list the currently running container the H flag allows us to specify the IP of our remote target.
docker -H tcp://TARGET-IP:2375 ps
