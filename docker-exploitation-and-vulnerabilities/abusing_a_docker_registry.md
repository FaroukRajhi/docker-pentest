We can launch an nmap scan to check on which port a Docker registry is running:
nmap -sV -p- <Registry-IP-Address>

The docker registry is a JSON endpoint, so we cannot just simply interact with it like we would a normal website we will have to query it.
Whilst this can be done via the terminal or browser,, dedicated tools such as postman or insomnia are much better suited for the job.

We can send a GET request to http://target:5000/v2/_catalog to list all the repositories.
To query all published tags of a repository we can send a GET request to http://target:5000/v2/repository/name/tags/list.
